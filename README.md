# RC700-bios

![front of old print](IMG_9878.jpeg)

I reverse engineered the RC702 bios on the system I got from DIKU when
they upgraded their computer terminal rooms in the early eighties to
get keyboard and serial buffering (otherwise the 19.2k modem was too
fast).

This is the various files I've found on the 8" floppies I still had
around in 2021. It turned out that since I printed out the listing on
1993-04-19 I added LaTeX, Disk and ISO-8859-1 keyboard support
labelled 1993-07-25 (most likely for QTERM modem communications to
IMADA).

To get the utilities on MacOS, run
